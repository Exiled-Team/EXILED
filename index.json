Then, clone it to your computer like so: git clone https://github.com/your-username/EXILED.git Open a terminal in your forked EXILED folder and run git checkout dev . This will switch you to the dev branch, which all pull requests should be submitted to. Setting EXILED_REFERENCES If you haven't already, install the SCP: Secret Laboratory Dedicated Server through Steam or extract this zip file to an easily accessible folder. Windows users Open the Environment Variables menu by searching for Environment Variables in the Start Menu. Create a new environment variable titled EXILED_REFERENCES . The value should point to your_steamapps_directory/common/SCP Secret Laboratory Dedicated Server/SCPSL_Data/Managed , or to the folder where you extracted the zip file mentioned earlier. Linux users Add export EXILED_REFERENCES=\"PATH\" to your ~/.bashrc or similar file. PATH should point to your_steamapps_directory/common/SCP Secret Laboratory Dedicated Server/SCPSL_Data/Managed , or to the folder where you extracted the zip file mentioned earlier. You should now be able to open the EXILED directory in your favorite IDE. Once you are done, test your changes thoroughly, and then submit a pull request to the main EXILED repository. Make sure you are targeting the dev branch, not master ! Happy coding! Contributing docs Documentation is built using DocFX. Forking EXILED First, create a fork of our GitHub repository . Then, clone it to your computer like so: git clone https://github.com/your-username/EXILED.git Open a terminal in your forked EXILED folder and run git checkout dev . This will switch you to the dev branch, which all pull requests should be submitted to. DocFX installation If you have Chocolatey installed, installation is simple as choco install docfx Homebrew installation is just as simple: brew install docfx You can also get it via NuGet: nuget install docfx.console Writing and building docs All of our articles live in the docs/ directory in the root of the repository. To make a new article, simply create a new Markdown (.md) file in the docs/articles folder with a descriptive name. Then, add it to the toc.yml located in that same folder. For more information on toc.yml formatting, check the DocFX documentation. You can then write your article using Markdown. For more information on Markdown syntax, check out Markdown Guide. To build documentation, run docfx docfx.json and the completed documentation will be generated in _site/ . Do not push _site to GitHub, as GitHub Actions will generate updated documentation when it is pushed to master. You can then open _site/index.html in your favorite web browser to preview the results. Once you are done, submit a pull request to the main EXILED repository. Make sure you are targeting the dev branch, not master!"
