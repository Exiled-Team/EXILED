    "keywords": "Exiled Introduction About EXILED EXILED is a low level plugin framework for SCP: Secret Laboratory. It offers an event system for developers to hook in order to manipulate or change game code, or implement their own functions. All EXILED events are coded with Harmony using IL transpilers, meaning they require no direct editing of server Assemblies to function, which allows for two unique benefits. The entirety of the frameworks code can be freely published and shared. Allowing developers to better understand how it works, as well as contributing to the framework itself. Since all of the code related to the framework is done outside of the server assembly, things like small game updates will have little, if any, effect on the framework. Frequently Asked Questions What is EXILED? EXILED - short for \"EXtended In-runtime Library for External Development\" is a plugin framework for SCP: Secret Laboratory compatible with MP2. It is not a direct replacement for SMOD, but it's purpose is to implement an event-based framework using Harmony patches, that plugin developers can utilize to develop plugins for SCP:SL servers. How do I install EXILED? See the Installation page for installation information. How do I install plugins? All plugins contain a DLL file (found in its latest release) that is used to load the plugin. Place the plugin in the appropriate plugin folder. Windows: %AppData%\\EXILED\\Configs(ServerPortHere)-configs.yml Linux: ~/.config/EXILED/Configs(ServerPortHere)-configs.yml Where is plugin configuration stored? Plugin configuration is stored in a separate folder than the base-game config files. Windows: %AppData%\\EXILED\\Plugins Linux: ~/.config/EXILED/Plugins Is there a plugin for upgrading items in hand, inside SCP-914? No, this is unnecessary because this is a base-game feature! Simply set the 914_mode config_gameplay config to DroppedAndHeld . What is Harmony? Harmony is a library that examines the code of a program as it is being run, allowing developers to tap into those functions, and run their own code, either adding onto, or completely replacing, the code the program would normally run. The reason EXILED uses harmony is to allow easier updating of the framework in conjunction with game updates. Under ideal circumstances, a new game update will not break EXILED itself, and the only thing needed to make EXILED work again, is a very simple copy/paste of a few lines of code into the new Assembly-CSharp file. By keeping all of our code outside of the Assembly, other developers can have full, unhindered access to the entirety of EXILED's source code, making collaboration easier. Additionally, it means that our code will be mostly unaffected by game updates. Unless the game drastically changes code in a very specific function EXILED uses for an event patch, a game update may not even require EXILED itself to also be updated."

    "keywords": ":::caution This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with C# and with setting up a plugin in the EXILED framework. See the tutorial if you are unfamiliar with setting up a plugin using EXILED. ::: Events: What are they? Events play a key role in the EXILED framework and all of the plugins utilizing it. Almost every plugin created using the EXILED framework uses events in one way or another. So, what are they? An event is a simple way of being informed when something happens. Events range from the round ending, to a player throwing an item or opening a door, to even SCP-096 being enraged! Events allow you to attach code that executes when something occurs before, during, or at the conclusion of a round. For example, say that you have the following method. public void OnDead() { // Show hint to player. } With EXILED, it is possible to achieve the desired result: Showing a hint to a player who dies. Event structure The EXILED framework consists of two different types of events: Events that can be disallowed, and those that cannot. Events that can be disallowed can prevent certain events from happening; as an example, preventing a player from dying when they normally should. The ability to prevent certain events from happening is what gives EXILED its beauty. All events are part of a static class called a handler . All handlers can be found in the Exiled.Events namespace. Every handler is related to a specific feature in the game (eg. Exiled.Events.Scp096 contains SCP-096 related events). Almost all events have a corresponding event argument class. The event argument provides the data of an event, as well as the ability to prevent it from occurring. All event arguments can be found in the Exiled.Events.EventArgs namespace, and all event arguments inherit from System.EventArgs . Example: Enraging event The following is the structure of the Exiled.Events.EventArgs.EnragingEventArgs . public class EnragingEventArgs : System.EventArgs { // Note: Constructor omitted. public Scp096 Scp096 { get; } // The SCP-096 instance. public Player Player { get; } // The player controlling SCP-096. public bool IsAllowed { get; set; } // Whether or not SCP-096 can be enraged. } Notice the IsAllowed property of the event. This property, which defaults to true , can be set to false to prevent SCP-096 from being enraged. For most events that can be disallowed, IsAllowed is set to true by default, and plugins can set it to false to prevent the event from occurring. However, in some cases, IsAllowed defaults to false and plugins can set it to true to allow the event to occur. An example of this behavior is the InteractingDoor event. IsAllowed will default to false in this event if a player cannot open a door, however plugins may set it to true to allow the player to open it regardless. Connecting events Events can be connected and disconnected by using the += and -= operators. These can be used in the plugin's OnEnabled and OnDisabled methods, respectively. // Base plugin class // This example assumes a method called \"OnEnraging\" exists in this class. For best practice, you should create a new class to handle events. using Exiled.Events; public override void OnEnabled() { Scp096.Enraging += OnEnraging; // Scp096 is the event handler, while Enraging is the name of the event. The += operator connects this event to the provided method. } public override void OnDisabled() { Scp096.Enraging -= OnEnraging; // The -= operator disconnects this event from the provided method. } // Some other class using Exiled.Events.EventArgs; public void OnEnraging(EnragingEventArgs ev) // ev is the arguments for the event. Every event has a different argument class with different parameters, so make sure to check its documentation. { Log.Info(ev.Player.Nickname + \" has just been enraged!\"); }"

    "keywords": ":::caution This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with C# and with setting up a plugin in the EXILED framework. See the Plugin Structure tutorial if you are unfamiliar with setting up a plugin using EXILED . ::: MEC (More Effective Coroutines) If you are unfamiliar with MEC, this will be a very brief and simple primer to get you started. MEC Coroutines are basically timed methods, that support waiting periods of time before continuing execution, without interrupting/sleeping the main game thread. MEC coroutines are safe to use with Unity, unlike traditional threading, which will crash the server. MEC is useful for plugins which require a pre-defined timeout between execution. As an example, an automatic nuke plugin would want to pause for a certain amount of seconds before activating the warhead. A supply drop plugin would want to wait in certain intervals before executing a supply drop. Both of these are possible with MEC. Setup Unlike other API provided by SCP:SL, MEC requires a reference to the Assembly-CSharp-firstpass DLL file. After referencing this file, a using MEC; statement allows MEC to be used. Coroutine MEC offers tons of features for controlling threads. For this tutorial, we are going to look at two of them: coroutines, and delayed calls. A coroutine is a method that is executed by MEC and supports delays. These methods must return type IEnumerator<float> and must be called by Timing.RunCoroutine(Method()) . An example can be seen below, using an infinite loop with a 5 second delay. using MEC; using Exiled.API.Features; public void SomeMethod() { Timing.RunCoroutine(MyCoroutine()); } public IEnumerator<float> MyCoroutine() { for (;;) //repeat the loop infinitely { Log.Info(\"Hey, I'm a infinite loop!\"); //Call Log.Info to print a line to the game console/server logs. yield return Timing.WaitForSeconds(5f); //Tells the coroutine to wait 5 seconds before continuing. Since this is at the end of the loop, it effectively stalls the loop from repeating for 5 seconds. } } This example prints, \"Hey, I'm an infinite loop!\" every 5 seconds infinitely. Coroutines can have multiple yield return statements. Delayed Calls A simpler method of running an action after a delay is using Timing.CallDelayed(float, Action) , which executes code after a given number of seconds passes. This method does not require a coroutine to be created, hence why it's useful. An example can be seen below, logging a message 5 seconds after the method is called. using MEC; using Exiled.API.Features; public void SomeMethod() { Timing.CallDelayed(5f, () => // Execute the provided method 5 seconds late. { Log.Info(\"This log was printed 5 seconds late!\"); }) } It is strongly recommended that you do some googling, or ask around in the EXILED Discord server if you are unfamiliar with MEC and would like to learn more, get advice, or need help. Questions, no matter how 'stupid' they are, will always be answered as helpfully and clearly as possible for plugin developers to excel. Better code is better for everyone."
